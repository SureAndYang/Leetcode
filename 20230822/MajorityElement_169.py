""" Easy, Majority Element
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than âŒŠn / 2âŒ‹ times. You may assume that the
majority element always exists in the array.

    The time complexity of this solution seems to be O(n^2), but actually more than half elements
    are the Majority Element which means we 'should' get the majority by choosing two numbers
    randomly. Thus, the real time complexity is O(n).

    PS: Whether using `random.randint(0, len(nums))` or `random.choice(nums)` to get a number can
    get wrong answer randomly. I dont know why.
